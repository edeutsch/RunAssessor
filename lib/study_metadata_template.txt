# Template version: 0.1
# This file encodes human-provided information that is used by the metadata_handler to guide SDRF creation
# SDRF specification: https://github.com/bigbio/proteomics-sample-metadata/tree/master/sdrf-proteomics
# Format for this file:
#   - Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored
#   - All other lines should be in the format of key=value
#     (where key is an SDRF key, and value is an SDRF value)
# If the answer for any of these attributes is "it's not the same for all files", then it probably should be left blank here and filled in later

# Note: The dataset identifier, usually a PXD, PDC, MSV, etc. identifier
# Example: PXD004684
