Notes developing RunAssessor et al.

Overview of files:

Old RunAssessor files:
- metadata_handler.py		- RunAssessor related. Handles study metadata files. infers search criteria
- mzML_assessor.py		- RunAssessor really. Haven't touched a while. Some methods stale perhaps

New SpectrumAnnotator:
- mass_reference.py		- Quite modern: to do: organize a bit better. Can parse chem formulas now
- peptidoform.py		- Over simple peptidoform class. Should be merged with USI peptidoforms
- spectrum_annotator.py		- Quite modern spectrum annotator. Has the most modern methods
- spectrum.py			- Modernish general spectrum class. Basic data. can fetch. opposite spectralLibraries spectrum.py


- pepXMLreader.py		- Unrelated pepXML reader plopped here
- spectrum_processor.py		- My de novo engine. Has grown stale against spectrum_annotator. Update it!
